To learn the following : -&lt;br>1. Actuate one double acting cylinder using AND gate (to and fro can be any actuation/return type) using single DCV (free to choose any). 2. Simultaneously expand two double acting cylinders (retraction can be any) using air pilot valve. 3. Make a circuit of retention switch using push button (Hint: Use relay) 4.Expand single double acting cylinder using relay and retraction can be any way 5. Actuate two double acting cylinders in which 2nd one should start expanded once the 1st one fully expanded and both should retract automatically after both cylinders got expanded.
