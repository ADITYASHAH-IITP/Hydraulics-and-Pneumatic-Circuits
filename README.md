# Hydraulics-and-Pneumatic-Circuits
To learn the following : <br>
<t><b>   &emsp;Pneumatic Circuits:-</b>
1. Actuate one double acting cylinder using AND gate (to and fro can be any actuation/return type) using single DCV . <br>
2. Simultaneously expand two double acting cylinders (retraction can be any) using air pilot valve. <br>
3. Make a circuit of retention switch using push button <br>
4. Expand single double acting cylinder using relay and retraction can be any way <br>
5. Actuate two double acting cylinders in which 2nd one should start expanded once the 1st one fully expanded and both should retract automatically after both cylinders got expanded.<br>
  
  <t><b>   &emsp;Hydraulics Circuits:-</b>
1. Design a hydraulic circuit to control speed and direction of hydraulic
motor. The circuit may be operated using one pushbutton or retention
switch. <br>
2. Implement a Quick Return Mechanism for a double acting hydraulic
cylinder, where forward stroke velocity is slow and controllable (Like in
Shaper), and return stroke should be faster than forward stroke.<br>
3. Design a hydraulic circuit to actuate hydraulic motor after complete
expansion of double acting cylinder. (Such kinds of combination of
motions is required for carrying out tasks in industry. For e.g. drilling a
hole on work piece after securing it on fixture). (Hint: after complete
expansion, pressure builds up in piston side, use a 3-way pressure
regulator to direct the flow after the pressure reaches a certain limit. You
may decide the limit)<br>
4. Electro-hydraulics problem
